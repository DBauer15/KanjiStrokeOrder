# ANKI Kanji Stroke Order

This add-on for Anki will automatically download and display a stroke order chart for a given Kanji card.

Requirements:

- The Kanji has to be on the question side of the card
- There can't be anything else on this side of the card
(HTML markup doesn't affect this)


Most Kanji decks meet these requirements.

I hope this will be of some use for you.

Enjoy!
